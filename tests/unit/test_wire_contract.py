The registry in ``demos/realtime_motion_graph_web/protocol.py`` is the single
source of truth for the command/event vocabulary served at ``/api/protocol``

dispatcher or the browser protocol client grows a message type the registry
doesn't declare (or vice versa) — so a new verb cannot be added on either side
