"""ACEStepBackend: the ACE-Step diffusion stack behind the
:class:`~acestep.streaming.generator_backend.GeneratorBackend` seam.

Extracted verbatim from the pre-seam ``PipelineRunner.run()`` loop body
(Phase 1 of ``round_3_BACKEND_PLAN_FINAL.md``): everything that knows
about latents, the StreamHandle, the StreamPipeline, curves, walk
windows, LoRA refits, or the VAE lives here; the runner keeps pacing,
the adaptive lead, idle staging, loop-band targeting, crossfading, and
emission. Zero intended behavior change — the golden harness is the
acceptance gate.

Specializes :class:`~acestep.streaming.diffusion_backend.
DiffusionBackend` (the shared Tier-1 skeleton): the base owns the
produce-mode dispatch / renderable-state caching / timing; this class
owns the ACE knob translation, walk-window source choreography, LoRA
refit signaling, and windowed VAE rendering. Its Tier-2 adapter is the
default ``ACEAdapter`` constructed inside the StreamHandle's
``StreamPipeline``; its codec is the engine ``Session`` (windowed VAE
decode), passed to the base as ``codec=``.
