"""GeneratorBackend: the universal seam between the streaming runner and
whatever generates the audio.

The runner (:mod:`acestep.streaming.pipeline_runner`) owns pacing, the
adaptive playback lead, idle pause staging, loop-band decode targeting,
crossfading, and emission. Everything model-shaped — knob supply and
translation, generation, decode/render, stall signaling, per-generation
params echo — lives behind this protocol. The ACE-Step diffusion stack
implements it in :mod:`acestep.streaming.ace_backend`; future families
(SA3 via a ``ModelAdapter`` inside the diffusion backend, token/AR
models like Magenta RT2 directly) implement it without forking the
runner.

Design reference: ``round_3_BACKEND_PLAN_FINAL.md`` (repo root of the
authoring worktree). Deviations from that document's sketch, forced by
the real runner loop and recorded here so the doc can be updated from
working code:

* ``tick(knobs) -> AudioChunk`` is split into :meth:`~GeneratorBackend.produce`
  (one generation step) and :meth:`~GeneratorBackend.render_window`
  (audio at a position from current state). The runner performs up to
  two renders per tick (main window + loop-band wrap), gap-fills from
  the backend's cached state when production stalls, and keeps
  rendering through DiT-pause — one fused call cannot express that.
* :meth:`~GeneratorBackend.produce` takes a mode because the historical
  loop runs the full knob-translation/prepare path on EVERY active tick
  (shared-curve writes land even on ticks that skip the engine), and
  the idle DiT-pause path re-adopts cached state *as a fresh
  generation* (it bumps ``num_gens``, restamps the params echo, and
  feeds the feedback history). Byte-identical extraction requires
  modeling those modes explicitly.
* :meth:`~GeneratorBackend.sync_source` exists because source-swap /
  walk-chunk cache resets happen at a fixed point in the historical
  loop (after idle staging, before the knob read), and the runner's
  stall-deferral choreography observes backend cache state both before
  and after that point.
* Stall signaling is two boolean hooks at the two points the loop
  pre-covers today: refit work that happens inside ``before_tick``
  (:meth:`~GeneratorBackend.has_pending_refit`, checked before the hook
  runs) and rebuilds triggered by knob changes observed this tick
  (:meth:`~GeneratorBackend.rebuild_imminent`, checked after the knob
  read). The stall-magnitude estimate (prewarm) stays in the runner: it
  is learned from observed inter-write gaps, which are runner state.
* GPU timing (``tick_ms`` / ``dec_ms``) is measured inside the backend
  (it owns the device synchronization points); the runner reads
  :attr:`~GeneratorBackend.last_tick_ms` / :attr:`~GeneratorBackend.last_dec_ms`
  only for its latency trace line.
* :meth:`~GeneratorBackend.knob_specs` takes the session's enabled-LoRA
  id list instead of the plan's no-arg sketch: the enabled set is
  session-tracked state (pending initial enables at ``ready`` time,
  live toggles afterwards) that the backend cannot observe on its own,
  while WHICH specs that set expands to stays family knowledge behind
  the seam.
