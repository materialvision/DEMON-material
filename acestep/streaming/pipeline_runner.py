"""PipelineRunner: the backend-agnostic streaming loop.

Drives a :class:`~acestep.streaming.generator_backend.GeneratorBackend`
each iteration and owns everything position- and pacing-shaped:

* the monotonic playhead estimate,
* the adaptive playback lead (interval EMA + stall bump),
* idle GPU pause staging,
* loop-band-aware decode targeting,
* crossfading freshly rendered windows into the live buffer,
* emission (``patch_window`` + ``on_audio_ready``).

Everything model-shaped — knob supply/translation, generation,
decode/render, stall signaling, the per-generation params echo — lives
behind the backend seam (see ``generator_backend.py``; the ACE-Step
implementation is ``ace_backend.py``). Phase 1 of
``round_3_BACKEND_PLAN_FINAL.md``: this split is a pure refactor of the
old fused loop, gated by the golden harness staying bit-exact.

        #      produces no new generation, re-render its cached state at the
        #      advancing playhead so a slice still lands. This collapses the
        #      inter-write interval to ~1 tick everywhere, so the burst stalls
        #      never reach the lead at all.
        #   2) This adaptive lead: an EMA of the (now ~1-tick) inter-write
        #      interval, scaled by a small gain, plus a fixed transit margin.
        #      Smooth because gap-fill removed the bursts that used to jerk it.
        #      It still self-sizes: heavier per-step compute (RCFG full, LoRA
        #      stacks, steps=16) lengthens the tick, the EMA tracks it, the
        #      lead grows proportionally. No magic constant.
        #
        # The one interval gap-fill cannot remove is a genuine pipeline rebuild
