        #     playhead a freshly decoded slice is written so it lands before

        # parts that together make the lead small AND smooth across the whole
        # depth x steps grid:
        #
        #   1) GAP-FILL (in ``run()``): on an active tick where ``stream.tick()``
        #      returns no new generation, re-decode the last latent at the
        #      advancing playhead so a slice still lands. This collapses the
        #      inter-write interval to ~1 tick everywhere, so the burst stalls
        #      never reach the lead at all.
        #   2) This adaptive lead: an EMA of the (now ~1-tick) inter-write
        #      interval, scaled by a small gain, plus a fixed transit margin.
        #      Smooth because gap-fill removed the bursts that used to jerk it.
        #      It still self-sizes: heavier per-step compute (RCFG full, LoRA
        #      stacks, steps=16) lengthens the tick, the EMA tracks it, the
        #      lead grows proportionally. No magic constant.
        #
        # The one interval gap-fill cannot remove is a genuine pipeline REBUILD

        # iteration — no loop turn runs to gap-fill it. ``_stall_extra_s``
