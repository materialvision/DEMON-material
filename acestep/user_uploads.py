"""User-uploaded audio library.

Mirrors the test-fixture library (``acestep.fixtures``) but is
operator-managed: the rtmg backend's WebSocket upload handler writes
audio files into :func:`acestep.paths.user_uploads_dir` and pairs each
with a precomputed sidecar (see :mod:`acestep.sidecars`). Subsequent
sessions that reference the same name as ``fixture_name`` hit the same
sidecar fast path test fixtures do — there's only one code path
through the pipeline regardless of how the audio landed on disk.

This module owns only the disk-layout half (listing + path lookup +
sidecar read). The write half is :mod:`acestep.sidecars`; callers run
:func:`acestep.sidecars.encode_and_save_sidecar` against
``user_uploads_dir()`` directly.
