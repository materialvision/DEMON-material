# demon-client

Browser SDK for the DEMON realtime music backend. Everything a frontend
needs to drive a live generative-music session: the WebSocket session
client, the binary slice decoder, realtime audio playback, reconnect
orchestration, and typed access to the backend's self-describing
manifests.

Nothing in this directory imports from the host app (drift-guarded by
`tests/unit/test_client_sdk.py`), so it can be copied or packaged
standalone. The shipped demo UI in `../` is itself a consumer, imported
via the `@demon/client` tsconfig alias.

## What the backend gives you

The control surface is backend-owned and self-describing. Build against
these, not against hardcoded shapes:

| Surface | What it is |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/protocol` | Full wire contract: every command you may send, every event you'll receive, the session-init config schema, and the upload handshake. `fetchWireContract()`. |
| `GET /api/knobs` | The knob manifest for the `params` channel: name, type, range, options, group, description. `fetchKnobManifest()`. |
| `types/wireContract.gen.ts` | The same contract as compile-time TypeScript types, generated from the Python registry. Typecheck against these. |
| MCP (`describe_protocol`, `list_knobs`) | Same manifests for agent consumers. |

## Quickstart

```ts
import {
  AudioPlayer,
  RemoteBackend,
  SLICE_FLAG_DELTA,
  type AudioSlice,
  type SessionConfig,
} from "@demon/client";

// 1. Source audio: interleaved float32 PCM at 48 kHz, plus channel count.
//    (Decode a file with WebAudio's decodeAudioData, or fetch a fixture
//    the pod already has and set use_server_fixture to skip the upload.)
const config: SessionConfig = { prompt: "minimal techno", depth: 4 };

// 2. Connect. The constructor takes the WS URL, the PCM, and the config;
//    connect() resolves after the ready handshake + initial buffer.
const remote = new RemoteBackend("ws://localhost:1318", interleaved, 2, config);

// 3. Play. AudioPlayer needs the worklet asset served at workletUrl
//    (copy assets/audio-worklet.js into your static dir).
const player = new AudioPlayer();
remote.addEventListener("slice", (e) => {
  const s = (e as CustomEvent<AudioSlice>).detail;
  if (s.epoch !== player.swapCount) return; // drop pre-swap stragglers
  if (s.flags === SLICE_FLAG_DELTA) player.addDelta(s.startSample, s.audio);
  else player.patch(s.startSample, s.audio);
});

await remote.connect();
await player.init(remote.initialBuffer!, remote.channels);
await player.resume();

// 4. Drive it. Send the FULL knob dict every UI tick (the app uses ~125 Hz)
//    with the playhead position in seconds. Knob names/ranges come from
//    /api/knobs; values are clamped server-side.
setInterval(() => {
  remote.sendParams({ denoise: 0.4, feedback: 0.1 }, player.positionSec);
}, 8);

// Discrete controls are typed senders: sendPrompt, sendSetPromptBlend,
// sendEnableLora, sendSwapSourceByName, sendSetTimbreFixture, ...
```

## The protocol state machine (what the manifests can't tell you)

1. **Init handshake.** First frame is the JSON `SessionConfig`. Unless
   `use_server_fixture` is set, one binary frame follows: `<II` header
   (channels, samples) + interleaved float32 PCM. The server replies
   with the `ready` JSON, then a binary float16 initial buffer.
   `RemoteBackend.connect()` runs all of this.
2. **Slice stream.** Audio arrives as binary frames: a 23-byte header
   (see `SLICE_HDR_SIZE` and the worker) + float16 PCM, either raw or
   zstd-compressed as a *delta against your local buffer mirror*.
   `RemoteBackend` decodes off-thread and emits `slice` events;
   `AudioPlayer.patch`/`addDelta` maintain the mirror. You cannot skip
   slices: the delta basis would desync.
3. **Swaps.** `swap_ready` JSON is followed by a full binary replacement
   buffer; `RemoteBackend` pairs them and bumps its slice epoch so
   in-flight slices for the old source are droppable (`slice.epoch` vs
   `AudioPlayer.swapCount`). `stem_assets` similarly heralds one binary
   buffer per listed stem.
4. **Echo channels.** Commands marked `origin_sensitive` in the contract
   are applied when sent on the session's own WS and echoed back
   (`params_echo`, `prompt_blend_echo`) when driven externally (MCP),
   so a UI can mirror agent-driven changes.
5. **Upload handshake.** A connection whose first frame is
   `{type: "upload_track"}` + PCM persists a track on the pod without
   starting a stream (`upload_ok` / `upload_failed`), then closes.

## Host integration points

- **Worklet asset**: serve `assets/audio-worklet.js`; override the path
  via `AudioPlayerOptions.workletUrl` if you don't serve it at
  `/audio-worklet.js`.
- **Prompt transform**: `RemoteBackendOptions.promptTransform` is applied
  to tags on every `sendPrompt`. The demo app injects enabled-LoRA
  trigger prefixes there. Omit it and prompts are sent verbatim.
- **Loudness matcher tuning**: `AudioPlayerOptions.loudnessConfig`
  (lazy provider, all fields optional).
- **State**: the SDK never writes app state. Subscribe to the
  `RemoteBackend` CustomEvents (`ready`, `slice`, `swap_ready`,
  `swap_failed`, `stem_assets`, `depth_applied`, `params`,
  `params_echo`, `lora_catalog`, `close`, ...) and mirror what you need.
- **Reconnect**: `wsReconnect.ts` provides the backoff loop; the backend
  has no session resume, so reconnect = re-run the full handshake with
  your own retained state. See the demo's `useStartSession.ts` for a
  reference orchestration.

## Keeping types in sync

`types/wireContract.gen.ts` is generated from the Python registry:

```
python demos/realtime_motion_graph_web/scripts/gen_wire_types.py
```

CI fails if the committed file is stale, if the dispatcher handles a
command the registry doesn't declare, or if this SDK handles an event
the registry doesn't declare. At runtime, compare `PROTOCOL_VERSION`
against the served contract's `version` to detect a stale build.
