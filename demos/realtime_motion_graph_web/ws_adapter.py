"""WebSocket transport adapter for the realtime motion-to-music demo.

Provides :func:`handle_client`, the per-WebSocket coroutine wired in by
:mod:`.server`. Wraps a
:class:`~acestep.streaming.session.StreamingSession` behind the existing
WS wire protocol:

- Decodes incoming JSON frames into typed session method calls.
- Subscribes to the session's
  :class:`~acestep.streaming.events.EventBus` and serializes each typed
  event to the matching wire frame(s) under a per-connection
  ``send_lock`` so JSON + binary follow-ups stay atomic.
- Owns per-subscriber transport state: the :class:`SliceCodec` (zstd
  context + ``client_mirror`` delta basis), the control-bus inject
  queue, the init-timing latches.

Init handshake (the wire's ``ready`` JSON + binary buffer + optional
``stem_assets``/``stem_failed``) ships inline BEFORE the bus
subscription drains, since those frames are produced synchronously by
:meth:`StreamingSession.create` and have nothing to fan out yet.

Wire-format details live in :mod:`.audio_codec`; operations and
lifecycle live in :mod:`acestep.streaming.session`. :mod:`.server`
imports :func:`handle_client` directly from here.

# A single eager encoder Session per checkpoint, shared across all
# connections and held for the process lifetime. This is the lone shared
# mutable GPU object in the system (every StreamingSession otherwise owns
# its own Session). The tradeoff is deliberate: encoding uploads needs the
# VAE encoder, which the streaming TRT path doesn't expose, so we keep a
# second eager copy of the weights rather than rebuild one per upload.
# Two costs follow from the sharing:
#   - VRAM: the eager weights occupy GPU memory WHILE AN UPLOAD IS IN
#     FLIGHT. Between uploads they are parked in system RAM
#     (ModelContext.offload_eager_to_cpu in _handle_upload_track's
#     finally); ModelContext._load_model_context lazily restores exactly
#     the modules the next upload touches. Without the parking, the
#     first upload would permanently pin ~6 GB next to the live
#     streaming session.
#   - Concurrency: prepare_source / stem extraction are NOT thread-safe on
#     a shared Session, so _UPLOAD_INFER_LOCK serializes all GPU work on it.

# The rtmg backend is one-session-per-pod: the TRT VAE cache, the LoRA
# library, and the GPU budget are all sized for exactly one streaming
# session. Two concurrent ``StreamingSession.create`` calls stack two
# full model stacks (OOM on a 24 GB card), and either session's
# teardown evicts shared TRT VAE cache entries out from under the
# other — the failure cascade is: dual create → one OOMs → its cleanup
# evicts the shared engines → the HEALTHY session crashes on its next
# decode. Doubled connections happen routinely (page reload while the
# old socket is still draining, dev StrictMode double-mount, a stale
# tab auto-reconnecting), so the policy is enforced here:
#
#   - ``_SESSION_LIFECYCLE_LOCK`` serializes preempt+create: at most one
#     session is ever being constructed, and construction never overlaps
#     another session's teardown.
#   - A new main-session connection PREEMPTS the active session: its
#     runner is stopped, its WebSocket is closed with
#     ``PREEMPTED_CLOSE_CODE`` (the client treats that close as final —
#     no reconnect war between two tabs), and the new connection WAITS
#     for ``StreamingSession.closed`` so the old stack's VRAM is
#     actually free before the new stack loads.

    #      no ack -> no flow control (legacy behavior).

    #      publish and serialization (send thread blocked in ws.send) is
    #      dropped. Catches the case where TCP itself pushes back.
