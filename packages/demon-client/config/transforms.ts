// untouched. Without this, the first non-web client to gain an export
// feature would silently drop `effects` / `curves` / `web` etc. authored by
// another frontend.
//
// Mechanism: `mergeConfig` stashes unknown top-level keys onto the result
// under a non-enumerable symbol, so they never leak through `{...cfg}`,
// `JSON.stringify(cfg)`, or a typed field — the re-emit is explicit, via
// `serializeConfig`. Web's own export models every schema field and handles
// its `inputs` / `tracks` extensions out of band, so it stays byte-identical
// (it does not call serializeConfig); the capability exists for M4L / VST.
